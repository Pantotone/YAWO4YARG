# ðŸ“¥ How to install

1. Download and unzip this repository. You can do by [clicking here](https://github.com/Pantotone/YAWO4YARG/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

2. Find where the `currentSong.json` is stored. By default, the file is located on YARG's app data folder. 

    You can find by two ways:

    2.1. Copying the path from the settings.
    
    - Open YARG
    - Go to Settings
    - In File Managment Section, click `Copy Current Song JSON File Path`
    - Go to your Finder/Explorer, and paste/follow the path that's now on your clipboard.

    2.2. Find manually your app data.

    Here are the default paths for YARG's app data on each system.

    > Some folders might be hidden by your system. 

    - Windows: `C:\Users\<your username>\AppData\LocalLow\YARC\YARG`
    - Mac: `/Users/<your username>/Library/Application Support/YARC/YARG`
    - Linux: `~/.config/unity3d/YARC/YARG`

3. Extract this repository inside the YARG's app data folder.
4. Create a new Browser Source on your OBS.

    - On the browser settings, mark "Local file", and locate the extracted folder and select `YARG Widget.html`
    - Set the width as `1920` and height as `260`. If it's too big, you can resize the widget on your canvas after you add it.

5. **(optional)** Change current instrument on widget.

    > As for now, the widget isn't able to detect what instrument is being played. In case you're playing an instrument that's not the default Guitar, you might need to change inside the HTML code.

    5.1. Open `YARG Widget.html` with your code editor of choice. (or Notepad if you don't have installed)

    5.2. Search for `data-type` line.

    5.3. Change the text inside the following double quotes.

    > Available instruments:
    >
    > `GUITAR` - `GUITAR_COOP` - `REAL_GUITAR` - `RHYTHM` - `BASS` - `REAL_BASS` - `DRUMS` - `GH_DRUMS` - `REALDRUMS` - `KEYS` - `REAL_KEYS` - `VOCALS` - `HARMONY`

    > **Example:**
    >
    > If you're playing the keys, your code should be `data-type="KEYS"`
